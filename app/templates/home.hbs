    <h4>What is epoch time?</h4>
    <p>
      The Unix timestamp, also known as POSIX time or epoch time, is a system for tracking time in computing. It
      represents the number of seconds that have elapsed since the Unix epoch, which is defined as 00:00:00 UTC on
      January 1, 1970 (not counting leap seconds). This system was introduced as a convenient way to standardize time
      representation across different computer systems and programming languages, providing a simple numeric value that
      can be easily manipulated and compared.
    </p>
    <p>The Unix timestamp is widely used in software development for tasks such as measuring time intervals, scheduling
      events, and handling timestamps in databases. Despite its simplicity, the Unix timestamp has limitations, such as
      not accounting for leap seconds and its eventual rollover in the year 2038, which may lead to issues in systems
      that rely on 32-bit signed integers for time representation. However, it remains a fundamental concept in
      computing, forming the basis for various time-related operations in modern programming languages and frameworks.
