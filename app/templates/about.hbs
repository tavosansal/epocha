        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>Epocha is a very simple helper app for converting epochs to readable dates in your local timezone and UTC.</p>
        <p>It provides a real-time timestamp and the time in your current timezone and in UTC</p>
        <p>You can also paste a valid epoch into the input and it will be converted to your current selected timezone and UTC.
            <br>This will pause the real-time epoch calculation.<br>
            Press the play button again to return to the current epoch calculcation.</p>
        <p>You can use the timezone picker to convert from your local timezone to a different one.</p>
        <p>You can also add more converters to compare multiple dates and timestamps side by side.</p>

        <h3>Why did you name it 'Epocha'?</h3>
        <p>'Epocha' is the latin word for 'epoch'. I thought it sounded cool and the domain was available.</p>
